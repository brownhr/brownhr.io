  abstract = {Summary             There is heightened interest in using high-throughput sequencing technologies to quantify abundances of microbial taxa and linking the abundance to human diseases and traits. Proper modeling of multivariate taxon counts is essential to the power of detecting this association. Existing models are limited in handling excessive zero observations in taxon counts and in flexibly accommodating complex correlation structures and dispersion patterns among taxa. In this article, we develop a new probability distribution, zero-inflated generalized Dirichlet multinomial (ZIGDM), that overcomes these limitations in modeling multivariate taxon counts. Based on this distribution, we propose a ZIGDM regression model to link microbial abundances to covariates (e.g. disease status) and develop a fast expectation\textendash maximization algorithm to efficiently estimate parameters in the model. The derived tests enable us to reveal rich patterns of variation in microbial compositions including differential mean and dispersion. The advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulation studies and an analysis of a gut microbiome dataset.},

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)\textendash based technologies develop rapidly and have myriad applications in medicine and health care. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on the productivity, workflow, topics, and research landscape of AI in this field. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the global development of scientific publications and constructed interdisciplinary research topics on the theory and practice of AI in medicine from 1977 to 2018. Methods: We obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape. Results: The applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources. Conclusions: The application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies. AI might be one of the methods to narrow down the inequality in health care and medicine between developing and developed countries. Technology transfer and support from developed countries are essential measures for the advancement of AI application in health care in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Some models of textual corpora employ text generation methods involving n-gram statistics, while others use latent topic variables inferred using the ``bag-of-words'' assumption, in which word order is ignored. Previously, these methods have not been combined. In this work, I explore a hierarchical generative probabilistic model that incorporates both n-gram statistics and latent topic variables by extending a unigram topic model to include properties of a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model. The model hyperparameters are inferred using a Gibbs EM algorithm. On two data sets, each of 150 documents, the new model exhibits better predictive accuracy than either a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model or a unigram topic model. Additionally, the inferred topics are less dominated by function words than are topics discovered using unigram statistics, potentially making them more meaningful.},
